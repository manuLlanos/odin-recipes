    <h3>This homemade ravioli recipe includes a pesto-Alfredo sauce and marinara</h3>
    <p>Don't be intimidated by the large list of ingredients, it is well worth it!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>For the dough</b>: All-purpose flour, salt, eggs, water, and olive oil</li>
        <li><b>For the filling</b>: Ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, an egg, and dried parsley</li>
        <li><b>For the sauce</b>: Olive oil, garlic, prepared basil pesto sauce (you can use store-bought or homemade
            sauce),
            heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and marinara sauce</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the dough</b>: Make and knead the dough, then form it into a ball. Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate
            for at least 30 minutes. </li>
        <li><b>Make the filling</b>: Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside. </li>
        <li><b>Make the sauce</b>: Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a
            simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan. </li>
        <li><b>Assemble the ravioli</b>: Roll out the dough into sheets. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about an inch
            apart. Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual
            ravioli, then seal the edges.</li>
        <li><b>Cook and bake the ravioli</b>: Boil the ravioli in salted water until the dumplings rise to the top and the
            filling is hot. Drain well.</li>
        <li><b>Serve the ravioli</b>: Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the warmed marinara sauce, then finish with
            the sauce. </li>
    </ol>
